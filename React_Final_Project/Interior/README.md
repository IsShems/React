# You need to create a product website where you can add products to your cart. The quantity of a specific product added to the cart can be changed. You also need to simulate sending a completed order to the server

You will need to create a project using this [layout](https://www.figma.com/file/NBdyWNYPzd2cOvWsiNyjSD/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev).

## The main points to consider in the project:
The sorting order ‘newest first’, which is written in the layout, needs to be changed to ‘expensive first’.
When you hover over a card, the add to cart button should appear.
When you click on place an order, a modal window should appear with information about who ordered the product and the total amount ordered
It is not necessary to make an adaptation. Can only be done for large screens
You can download these photos in the layout and duplicate them on all product cards
When the quantity of goods decreases, the counter less than zero should not decrease
 
### Main React technologies that should be used in the project:
Redux ToolKit
React Router
Prop Types
 
### Technologies that can be used optionally:
Axios
React Modal
Ant Design
React Portals
React Context
 
I am giving you a json file that will need to be placed in the public folder. The array of products will need to be read using a request from fetch or axios. To read a file you only need to specify ‘/’ and the file name in the URL.

And here is the [file itself](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vJn6XZpj4iYbhmYH3OwJfeSvkphSOy_X/view?usp=sharing).
