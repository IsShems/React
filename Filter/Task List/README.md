# Filtering the list of elements

Create a React application that has a list of elements (for example, tasks)
and a text field to filter the list. Use the useState and useEffect hooks to control the list state and filter. 

A list of elements can be represented as an array of objects with id and name fields. As you enter text into the filter field,
the list should automatically update to show only the items that contain the entered text.
