# Task: Context
Description: Create an application with theme switching.

# Requirements:
1. The application must have two themes: light and dark.
2. There should be a button at the top of the application to switch the theme.
3. Create a ThemeContext that will store the current theme and a function to change it.
4. Use this context in different components of your application so that they adapt their style depending on the chosen theme.

Additionally:
â€¢ Add persistence of the selected theme to localStorage so that when the page is reloaded, the user's selected theme is retained.
