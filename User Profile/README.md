# User Profile in React

Create an application that displays
user profile with data such as: name,
age, profession and favorite book. There are buttons
for example, "Change profession to 'Teacher'" or
"Make 'War and Peace' your favorite book."

When you click on
These buttons and profile data change. In building
the applications you will use are functional
components, state (useState), props for
data transfers and event handlers for
data changes.
