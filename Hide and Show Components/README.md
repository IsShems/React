# Controlling Component Visibility

Create a React application that includes two components: ComponentA and ComponentB. 

Initially, both components should be hidden. Create two buttons: "Show A" and "Show B". 

When you click on the "Show A" button, ComponentA should become visible, and when you click on the "Show B" button, 
ComponentB should become visible. 

To control the visibility of components, use the useState hook and conditional rendering.
