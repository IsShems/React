# useRef: Focus on input

Goal: Use the useRef hook to control focus on the input element.

# Tasks:

1. Create a FocusInput component that contains a button and an input field.
2. When you click the button, the focus should be set to the input field.
3. To achieve this, use the useRef hook.
4. (Optional): Implement the logic so that when the page first loads, the input field automatically gets focus.
